# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Using Machine Learning algorithm to predict the heart disease
Note: Check the python file for model creation


Step 1: Importing Libraries

Step 2: Importing the heart dataset. The dataset has been taken from kaggle.

Step 3: Getting familiar with data
        Shape of the dataset, missing value in the dataset and general mathematical calculations.

Step 4: We have 5 categorical variables in the dataset. In order to create a model, we should encode that variables. So, that has been done.

Step 5: Splitted the dataset into training and testing data. The ratio of train and test is 80 and 20.

Step 6: Used Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier for prediction.

Step 7: Model fitting and confusion matrix to check the accuracy.

Step 8: Compared to Decision Tree Classifier we got high accuracy i.e., 86% in Logistic Regression.
